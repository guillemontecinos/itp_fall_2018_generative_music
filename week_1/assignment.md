## Generative Music Examples
### [Laurie Spiegel](http://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/laurie-spiegel-score/)
Even I didn't find a performed version of this piece I got very impressed of the notation used for composing it. This is a piece for two modular synths composed by Spiegel in 1970. It is interesting how the music sheet turns into a drawing paper -well, in essence it is a drawing paper- who supports expressive shapes: for example the noise -I think it is noise- is a dense bunch of lines who moves in the space and mixed to get fused in the end of the piece.

## Listen to Terry Tiley's 'in C'
I listened a few versions of 'in C' I found in youtube. The one I liked the most is the version performed bay Brooklyn Raga Massive, a Brooklyn based collective of raga enthusiastic musicians who gather to listen and play raga music. Raga is an Indian style of music that can be defined as 'a melodic framework for improvisation. Each raga is an array of melodic structures with musical motifs, considered in the Indian tradition to have the ability to "color the mind" and affect the emotions of the audience'(source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga)).
