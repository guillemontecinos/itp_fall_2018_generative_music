# Yes I'm Feelings
*Generative music piece built with Machine Learning from Radiohead's data by Sofía Suazo and Guillermo Montecinos for Generative Music class, NYU ITP Fall 2018.*

Yes I'm feelings is 2:19 minutes a musical piece inspired in Radiohead's [Fitter Happier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My10FLH5DT0) song from the album *Ok Computer*. It was build by predicting Radiohead-styled lyrics and melodies from two databases, which were live triggered from two computers. This piece was collaboration with [Sofía Suazo](https://www.sofialuisa.xyz/) for the midterm of the Generative Music class at NYU ITP, Fall 2018.

The piece's text were generated by a Markov Chain trained with Radiohead's lyrics and triggered in the browser using the library [p5.speech](http://ability.nyu.edu/p5.js-speech/), as is explained in the following post.

Besides, the music was generated using a [long short-term memory (LSMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) recurrent neural network (RRN) trained with data collected from MIDI files. The original idea was to compose a Thom Yorke-styled melody from of a bunch of Radiohead's songs but the difficulty of properly interpreting time from MIDI files brought us to reinterpret the result of the prediction process.

## Data collection
For addressing the goal of predicting a Radiohead-style melody a dataset of 18 MIDI files were collected from 

The data collected for addressing the project were MIDI files of Radiohead's songs.
