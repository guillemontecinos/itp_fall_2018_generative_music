2+2=5(The Lukewarm)
Are you such a dreamer,
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever,
Where two and two always makes a five
I'll lay down the tracks,
Sandbag and hide,
January has April showers,
And two and two always makes a five
It's the Devil's way now,
There is no way out,
You can scream and you can shout,
It is too late now
Because you have not been
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention
Yeah I feel it, I needed attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention
Yeah I need it, I needed attention,
I needed attention,
I needed attention,
I needed attention
Yeah I love it, the attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention,
Payin' attention
I try to sing along,
I get it all wrong,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies,
But like flies the buggers keep coming back
But I'm not,
Oh hail to the thief,
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in the dock,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not
Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in,
But it's not,
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not,
Maybe not
