Morning Bell
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah
Release me
Release me
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
