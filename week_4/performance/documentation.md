# Nicolasa
*Data sonification performance by Guillermo Montecinos for Generative Music class, NYU ITP Fall 2018.*

## Introduction
*Nicolasa* is a data sonification piece created from the real operation of the Chilean electric power system. The daily generation of the biggest dam power plants are used to create a sound landscape in which the voice of Nicolasa Quintremán demands to the Chilean Government and the Spanish Company Endesa to respect the territory of the Mapuche in southern Chile.

## The Original Idea
The original idea for this performance was to sonify the data of the entire Chilean power system in order to describe the internal interactions between the different kind of technologies that compose it. For that purpose, hydropower plants were going to be mapped to high pitch notes played by instruments as strings or piano, whilst thermal power plants -as coal or gas- were going to be mapped to low pitch notes, played by analog -robust- synths.

During my investigation I realized that this performance was an opportunity to unveil the political issues that underlie the development of the Chilean power system. In many cases, the construction of power plants has had an irreversible impact for the communities that live in the area before the projects were designed. This is the case of many small fishing creeks that were deeply affected by coal thermal power plants constructed in the shore near them, which used sea water to refresh their system, killing the fishes of the area. Similar cases occurred in southern areas were wind farms attempted to be installed in sacred land for indigenous communities which are protected by the [Convention C169](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C169).

## Historical Context
The most emblematic case is Ralco, a hydro power plant developed by the Spanish company Endesa which in the process of construction forced an entire community of Mapuche people to move from their land and flooded an ancestral graveyard. The construction of this project was supported by the Chilean Government.
Nicolasa Quintremán was the Mapuche leader who fought against Endesa and the Government and in her words can be found the proud and respect for her culture and her homeland. *"We will never get out of here, unless we are dead. Because we own the right, we own the mother, is a live mother, is the land. Mi mother died, but the land is alive and will live forever."*
